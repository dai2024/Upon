## About BWBASIC
BWBASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language developed by Thomas Kurtz and John Kemeny, the creators of the original BASIC language.

BWBASIC was widely used on computers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was easy for beginners to learn and was useful for understanding the basics of structured programming.

BWBASIC includes basic features of the BASIC language, such as variables, control flow, loops, conditional statements, functions, subroutines, arrays, string processing, and more. It also has simple graphics capabilities, such as drawing lines, circles, and filling shapes.

BWBASIC was originally provided as a command-line program that ran on DOS computers. Although it is no longer commonly used, it can still be used for learning purposes or for historical purposes.
