## What is bubble Sort?

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted in the desired order. It is called bubble sort because the smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list as the algorithm runs.

## What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. Insertion sort works by taking elements from the list one by one and inserting them in their correct position into a new, sorted list. The algorithm iterates through the input list and removes one element per iteration, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. The algorithm repeats until no input elements remain.
