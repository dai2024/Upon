### Name of the sample code: "HTML Template Generator"

Continuation of the sample code:

```go
func check(err error) {
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
}
```

Explanation:

The continuation of the code creates a program that generates an HTML template with the help of the Go template package. The code defines a struct type called Page which contains the title, heading, paragraphs, and a list of items to be displayed on the webpage.

The ```const tpl``` contains the HTML template that will be used to generate the HTML file. The ```{{.Title}}```, ```{{.Heading}}```, ```{{.Paragraphs}}```, and ```{{.List}}``` are placeholders for the values that will be substituted from the Page struct.

In the ```main``` function, a ```Page``` variable is created with some sample data. A new file is created called ```index.html``` and a new writer is created using ```bufio```. Then, a new template is created using the ```New``` method of the ```template``` package, passing the name of the template and the template string.

The ```Execute``` method is called on the template, passing in the writer and the ```Page``` struct. The values from the ```Page``` struct will be substituted into the template, and the resulting HTML will be written to the file.

Finally, a message is printed to the console indicating that the HTML template has been generated successfully.
