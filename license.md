# So how should I write this license notice?

If you are publishing code on GitHub, it is common to include a license notice that specifies the terms under which your code can be used by others. This helps to ensure that others understand how they can use your code and helps to protect your rights as the creator of the code.

Here is an example of how you could write a license notice:

```
MIT License

Copyright (c) [Year] [Your Name]

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.
```

Note that this is the text for the MIT License, which is a popular open-source license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute your code while retaining copyright. If you would like to use a different license, you should consult the terms of that license and modify the notice accordingly.

No, there should not be any problem with posting the code on GitHub. However, it's always a good idea to make sure that any code you publish is properly commented and formatted, and that you have the necessary permissions to use any code from third-party sources.
