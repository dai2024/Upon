### Grace Hopper (Grace Brewster Hopper)
1. COBOL

Grace Hopper did not create COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), but she was instrumental in its development and widespread adoption. She was a computer scientist and a United States Navy Rear Admiral who worked on the team that designed and implemented the first COBOL compiler. She was a pioneer in the field of computer programming and a strong advocate for the use of high-level programming languages, such as COBOL, to make computers more accessible to business users. Her contributions to the development of COBOL and other computer technologies have made a lasting impact on the field of computer science.

I think that Grace Hopper's philosophy of making programming accessible to a wider audience through the use of high-level programming languages that are closer to English is a crucial and visionary one. Her ideas have been instrumental in shaping the way we approach programming today, where the focus is on making coding more intuitive and user-friendly, and less focused on writing complex machine code. By making programming more accessible, Hopper paved the way for a broader range of people to participate in the field of computer science and technology, and her contributions have helped to democratize access to computing.

### UNIX
#### The UNIX philosophy is a set of principles for software design that were first articulated by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the developers of the original UNIX operating system. The key tenets of the UNIX philosophy include

1. Small is beautiful: UNIX utilities should be small, simple, and focused on doing one thing well.
1. Write programs to work together: UNIX utilities should be designed to work well with other programs, so that users can build powerful and flexible systems from small components.
1. Store data in flat text files: UNIX systems store data in flat text files, making it easy to manipulate and process data with other utilities.
1. Use shell scripts to automate tasks: The UNIX shell provides a powerful scripting environment for automating complex tasks.
1. Choose portability over efficiency: UNIX systems are designed to be portable, so that they can run on different hardware platforms with minimal modification.
1. Make every program a filter: UNIX utilities should be designed to take input from standard input and produce output to standard output, allowing users to easily chain utilities together to solve complex problems.
