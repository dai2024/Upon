Sally sells seashells by the seashore,\
but she sometimes forgets where she stored.\
If Sally forgets where she stored seashells,\
where should she search to find these seashells?

Betty bought butter but the butter was bitter,\
So Betty decided to mix the butter with litter.\
But if Betty mixes bitter butter with litter,\
Will the butter taste better, or just more bitter?

How much wood would a woodchuck chuck,\
If a woodchuck could chuck wood that's stuck?\
If the wood's stuck in the woodchuck's way,\
Would the woodchuck chuck it, or just walk away?

\
Two wooden beams wait where the water meets the wheat field,\
Two planks of wood rest by the road where the robin roams,\
Two logs of wood float on the lake where the loon lingers,\
Two timber poles stand tall where the tide turns turbulent,\
Two lumber pieces lie lost where the leaves litter the land.

Amidst the misty, mystic mountains,\
A mystic master makes his mightiest meditations.\
With his mind's eye, he measures the moods of the mountains,\
And molds his meditation into a magical motion.

Two metal bars lay where the sun sets behind the hill,\
Two bricks rest at the corner where the ivy climbs,\
Two glass panes shine on the roof where the stars twinkle,\
Two steel rods stand tall where the wind turns wild,\
Two paper sheets flutter where the breeze blows gently.

Tangled twigs twist where the sun dips 'neath the hill,\
Twisted tendrils tangle at the corner where the ivy crawls,\
Twinkling panes of glass on the rooftop where the stars dance,\
Toughened rods stand fast where the wild winds warble,\
Two paper pages flutter gently where the breeze blows bold.

The twigs that tangle, twist where the sun's last light lingers low 'neath the hill,\
Twisted tendrils tangle tight at the corner where creeping ivy crawls,\
Twinkling panes of glass on rooftop where stars shimmy and shake and prance,\
Toughened rods stand fast and firm where wild winds warble and wail,\
Two paper pages flutter fleetly where breezes boldly blow by.

\
"The tangled twigs and twisted tendrils below the hill where the sun's last light lingers appear to be entangling and twisting around two fluttering paper pages that the sun is fiercely trying to blow away with its powerful gusts. Meanwhile, the rooftop's twinkling panes of glass shimmer and shake as stars prance in the wind, and toughened rods stand fast and firm where wild winds warble and wail."

### Grace Hopper (Grace Brewster Hopper)
1. COBOL

Grace Hopper did not create COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), but she was instrumental in its development and widespread adoption. She was a computer scientist and a United States Navy Rear Admiral who worked on the team that designed and implemented the first COBOL compiler. She was a pioneer in the field of computer programming and a strong advocate for the use of high-level programming languages, such as COBOL, to make computers more accessible to business users. Her contributions to the development of COBOL and other computer technologies have made a lasting impact on the field of computer science.

I think that Grace Hopper's philosophy of making programming accessible to a wider audience through the use of high-level programming languages that are closer to English is a crucial and visionary one. Her ideas have been instrumental in shaping the way we approach programming today, where the focus is on making coding more intuitive and user-friendly, and less focused on writing complex machine code. By making programming more accessible, Hopper paved the way for a broader range of people to participate in the field of computer science and technology, and her contributions have helped to democratize access to computing.

### UNIX
#### The UNIX philosophy is a set of principles for software design that were first articulated by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, the developers of the original UNIX operating system. The key tenets of the UNIX philosophy include

1. Small is beautiful: UNIX utilities should be small, simple, and focused on doing one thing well.
1. Write programs to work together: UNIX utilities should be designed to work well with other programs, so that users can build powerful and flexible systems from small components.
1. Store data in flat text files: UNIX systems store data in flat text files, making it easy to manipulate and process data with other utilities.
1. Use shell scripts to automate tasks: The UNIX shell provides a powerful scripting environment for automating complex tasks.
1. Choose portability over efficiency: UNIX systems are designed to be portable, so that they can run on different hardware platforms with minimal modification.
1. Make every program a filter: UNIX utilities should be designed to take input from standard input and produce output to standard output, allowing users to easily chain utilities together to solve complex problems.

"escrivre" -> "écrire" -> "réécrire"

"scribere" is a Latin verb that means "to write" in English. It is the infinitive form of the word "scribo" in Latin, which was widely used in Latin texts and literary works during the ancient Roman era. The origin of "scribo" is uncertain, but many linguists believe it may be related to the Latin word "scrobis," which means to dig and make furrows in the ground. It is possible that the meaning of "scribo" as to inscribe characters onto a surface is derived from the idea of carving letters into the earth.

"Graphein" is a Greek verb that means "to write" in English. This word was widely used in ancient Greek texts of philosophy, literature, and science written in the Greek language. The origin of "graphein" is derived from the ancient Greek word "grapho," which means "to cut," "to carve," or "to write." This word originally referred to the act of carving or engraving letters or images, but later came to also mean writing with ink or other writing instruments.

An Upright Piano is a type of vertical piano, where the strings and soundboard are positioned vertically. It is also commonly referred to as a "vertical piano". It is smaller in size compared to a grand piano and more commonly found in homes, schools, and small performance spaces. Upright pianos are popular due to their compact size, affordability, and versatility. They come in different sizes and styles and can be used for playing a wide range of music genres.

Puzzle
---------------		
Rubik's cube

The Rubik's cube is a 3D combination puzzle that was invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. The puzzle consists of a cube made up of smaller cubes, or cubies, that can rotate around a central axis. The goal of the puzzle is to twist and turn the cube to return it to its original state, with each of its six faces having a single color. The Rubik's cube has become one of the most popular and iconic puzzles of all time, and has inspired countless imitators and variations. It remains popular to this day, with many people enjoying solving the puzzle for fun or as a competitive sport.

  spaces 2 or tabs 8
 
 Spaces and tabs are used in programming to define the structure and format of code. In most programming languages, indentation is used to define the structure of code blocks, such as loops and conditional statements. The number of spaces or tabs used to represent each level of indentation can vary depending on the coding style and the preferences of the programmer or development team.

The number "2" in "spaces 2" refers to the number of spaces used to represent each level of indentation. This means that each time the code block is indented, 2 spaces are added to the beginning of each line of code.

The number "8" in "tabs 8" refers to the number of spaces a tab character represents. In this case, each time the code block is indented, a tab character is added to the beginning of each line of code, which represents 8 spaces.

The choice of using spaces or tabs for indentation is largely a matter of personal preference and coding style. Some developers prefer to use spaces because it gives them more precise control over the indentation level, while others prefer tabs because it saves space and is easier to type.


  www = World Wide Web

The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to serve billions of users worldwide. It was created in 1989 by British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee and is now widely used for a variety of purposes, including accessing and sharing information, conducting business, and communicating with others.

The Web is based on the concept of hypertext, which allows users to navigate from one piece of content to another through links. This makes it easy for users to access a vast amount of information from a single location and has made the Web a critical tool for communication, commerce, and entertainment.

Today, the Web is used by billions of people worldwide and is widely regarded as one of the most important technological innovations of all time. It has transformed the way people access and share information, and has greatly impacted fields such as journalism, education, and commerce.


Value or worth refers to the intrinsic or assigned monetary or functional value of an object, asset, service, or idea. It can refer to the usefulness or usefulness to society of a particular item or concept, or it can refer to the amount of money that someone is willing to pay for it.

Value can be determined by several factors, including supply and demand, rarity, utility, and cultural significance. The value of an object can also change over time as economic, cultural, and technological factors shift.

In economics, value is a central concept, with theories about value and its relationship to price and supply and demand shaping economic thought and decision-making. In personal finance, understanding the value of assets and liabilities is critical for making informed decisions about spending and saving.

In a more abstract sense, value can refer to the worth or importance of an idea, person, or community, and can be shaped by cultural, social, and personal factors.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
|  \033[0m  |  Reset all styles and colors  |
|\033[1m	|Bold|
|\033[2m	|Dim|
|\033[3m	|Italic|
|\033[4m	|Underline|
|\033[5m	|Blink|
|\033[7m	|Invert colors|
|\033[8m	|Hide text|
|\033[30m	|Black text|
|\033[31m	|Red text|
|\033[32m	|Green text|
|\033[33m	|Yellow text|
|\033[34m	|Blue text|
|\033[35m	|Magenta text|
|\033[36m	|Cyan text|
|\033[37m	|White text|
|\033[40m	|Black background|
|\033[41m	|Red background|
|\033[42m	|Green background|
|\033[43m	|Yellow background|
|\033[44m	|Blue background|
|\033[45m	|Magenta background|echo "\033[31mHello, world!\033[0m"
|\033[46m	|Cyan background|These codes can be used in shell scripts, terminal applications, and more. For example, to display "Hello, world!" in red foreground color using the echo command, you can write:
|\033[47m	|White background|\033[31m is the code to specify red foreground color, and \033[0m is the code to reset the color and style.
